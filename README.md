Clustering slices in NIfTI volumes based on Perceptual Similarity or SSIM

This is an implementation of clustering (more specifically spectral clustering) slices in an MR Volume (NIfTI format) by using similarity measure such as
Perceptual Similarity or Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). 

Perceptual Similarity is implemented using Zhang et al's [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Deep Features as a Perceptual Metric](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03924.pdf).
